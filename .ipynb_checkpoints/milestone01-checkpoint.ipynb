Note that replacing dates with <DATE> is particularly tricky as dates can be expressed in many forms. It's ok to to just choose one or a few common date formats present in the data set and only replace those. (Be careful about tokenizing <> symbols because these are punctuation in most Tokenizers).\n",

Use it to implement the same cleaning steps as in your own clean_text implementation.\n",
